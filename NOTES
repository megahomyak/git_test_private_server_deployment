#### UPDATE ####

You don't have to do anything new now, now everything is handled by the deploy script. Pushing to Github and adding its repo is the same as always, and you *really* don't have to do anything to have it all work successfully. This is a message from megahomyak to megahomyak, by the way. Your mileage may vary.

Adding the repo as the first repo:
```
git remote add origin git@github.com:megahomyak/git_test_private_server_deployment.git
```

Adding the repo while there's already one repo added:
```
git remote set-url origin --add git@github.com:megahomyak/git_test_private_server_deployment.git # Original repo (that was added first); yes, that's genuinely how this is intended to be used
git remote set-url origin --add --push orange:git_test_private_server_deployment # Finally, the repo we want to add
```

But if one repo will be used only for deployment, IMO it will make sense to add another "remote" for it and only push there in deploy scripts:
```
git remote add origin git@github.com:megahomyak/git_test_private_server_deployment.git
git remote add deployment orange:git_test_private_server_deployment # Actually, this can be handled by the deploy script
```
